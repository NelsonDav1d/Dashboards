# Dashboards Test

## Introduction

This repository contains resources for creating dynamic dashboards for a synthetic logistics scenario. 
The primary components include Python code for generating synthetic data and a Power BI file demonstrating the visualization capabilities using the generated data.

## Folder Structure

- **Python:** Contains a script named 'CSV_Data.py' which generates synthetic data mimicking a logistics scenario.
- **Power_BI:** Holds a Power BI file named 'supply chain.pbix' showcasing the visualization possibilities with the data generated by 'CSV_Data.py'.

## Generating Synthetic Data

The'CSV_Data.py' script in the Python folder is designed to generate synthetic data for a fake logistics scenario. By running this script, users can customize and generate datasets tailored to their specific needs.

## Visualizing Data with Power BI

The 'supply chain.pbix' file in the Power_BI folder serves as an example of how the generated data from 'CSV_Data.py' can be visualized and analyzed using Power BI. Users can explore various interactive dashboards, charts, and reports to gain insights into the logistics scenario.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the Python folder and run the 'CSV_Data.py' script to generate synthetic data.
3. Open the 'supply chain.pbix' file in the Power_BI folder using Power BI Desktop.
4. Connect the Power BI file to the generated dataset.
5. Explore the pre-built dashboards and customize them according to your requirements.
